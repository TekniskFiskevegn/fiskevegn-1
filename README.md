## Graphql queries

Santiy requires a prepend of "sanity" in the query functions. This is some magic happening behind the curtains. 

I.e

    frontpage: sanityFrontpage {
      _id
    }

export default {
  name: "frontpage",
  type: "document",
  title: "Frontpage"
}

It takes the name: "frontpage" and uses this as a reference. So this becomes sanityFrontpage.


## Naming conventions

A new css module has to follow this naming convention in order to work, i.e: name.module.css

## Font management
`https://fontpair.co/` is a nice resource for finding good fonts.
Download the fonts from `https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts`

In this project these fonts are available in `public/static/fonts` folder:
1. Roboto
2. Roboto slab
3. Lato

I am hosting the font files locally. But another option is to use something like this in my custom.properties.css file:
`@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato&display=swap');`

## My own notes about workflow

Workflow for changes in studio

1. npm run dev 
2. Make changes in /schemas
3. This will update sanity studio
4. But Gatsby will fail
5. To fix this: npm run graphql-deploy
6. Restart npm run dev
7. Gatsby will most likely fail again, because of missing fields in the update sanity studio
8. To fix this: changes some content on the current document, and re-publish
9. It should now work

## My own notes about lerna

1. lerna add react --scope=web
2. lerna add react --scope=studio

## Static files - Adding assets outside of the module system
You can create a folder named static at the root of your project. Every file you put into that folder will be copied into the public folder. E.g. if you add a file named sun.jpg to the static folder, itâ€™ll be copied to public/sun.jpg
